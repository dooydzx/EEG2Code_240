The algorithm for EEG2Code, as described in the article, is provided in the file `EEG2Code_offline.py`. 
The file `calculateaccuracy.m` is used to compute the accuracy by comparing the predicted sequences generated by EEG2Code with the original sequences. 
Run `EEG2Code_offline.py` first, followed by `calculateaccuracy.m`. 
The computation should be feasible on a system with 32 GB of RAM and an NVIDIA GPU with at least 12 GB of VRAM.

Data can be fonded in https://zenodo.org/records/14587455.
The data for single-target and multi-target tests from 18 subjects are provided. Each file contains the training and testing data for one subject. The files labeled `01c` represent single-target test data, while those labeled `mc` represent multi-target test data. Each file includes:
- `test_data_x` of size 240 × 21 × 1170, representing the test EEG data (240 classes × 21 channels × 1170 data points).
- `train_data_y` of size  360 × 1000, representing the stimulus sequences during the training phase (30 sequences repeated 12 times=360 × 1000 data points).
- `train_data_x` of size 360× 21 × 1170,representing training EEG data (30*12=360 × 21 channels × 1000 data points).
This data structure is designed to support the training and testing of the EEG2Code algorithm.
